        <p>  <strong> Computer science </strong> is the study of computation, information, and automation.
            science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms,
            theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines 
            (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
            Though more often considered an academic discipline, 
            computer science is closely related to computer programming.

        <p> 
        <strong> Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>  is the intelligence of machines or software,
        as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is also the field 
        of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. 
        "AI" may also refer to the machines themselves.
